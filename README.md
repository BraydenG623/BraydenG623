## About Me
I'm a currently a Computer Engineering (CS Minor) student at Virginia Tech with a focus in Software Systems and a secondary in Machine Learning. My journey in computer science (CPE) encompasses both the theoretical and practical aspects of the field, diving into topics like Embedded Systems and Computational Engineering.

I have recently been enjoying testing my limits by expanding my expertise in various coding projects all involving different languages and frameworks. Here, outside of my personal projects, you may also find some of my school coding projects that I am proud of.

### Current Endeavors
I'm developing an AI-Powered Fitness Platform, integrating the cutting-edge OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API with full-stack development tools to personalize workout routines. I am utilizing frameworks like Node.js and BootStrap for this project as well. 

### Interests
Beyond the realm of technology, I like quality time with friends and family, working out, and diving into new innovative projects that combine the realms of hardware and software to solve real-world problems.
